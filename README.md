# mros2-mbed

mROS 2 (formally `mros2`) realizes a agent-less and lightweight runtime environment compatible with ROS 2 for embedded devices.
mROS 2 mainly offers pub/sub APIs compatible with [rclcpp](https://docs.ros2.org/foxy/api/rclcpp/index.html) for embedded devices.

mROS 2 consists of communication library for pub/sub APIs, RTPS protocol, UDP/IP stack, and real-time kernel.
This repository provides the reference implementation of mROS 2 that can be operated on the Mbed enabled board.
Please also check [mros2 repository](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2) for more details and another implementations.

      - [STM32 H747I-Discovery](https://www.st.com/ja/evaluation-tools/stm32h747i-disco.html)
        - Some modifications for hardware are needed to enable the Ethernet feature. See [details](https://os.mbed.com/teams/ST/wiki/DISCO_H747I-modifications-for-Ethernet)
      - [RENESAS GR-MANGO](https://www.renesas.com/products/gadget-renesas/boards/gr-mango)
  - Kernel: [Mbed OS 6](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os)
  - check the Mbed website for [the boards list](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/?q=&Mbed+OS+6=Bare+metal&Mbed+OS+6=RTOS&Communication=Ethernet) where mros2 may work. Please let us know if you find a new board that can work as mros2 enabled device.
- Host environment
  - [ROS 2 Foxy Fitzroy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
  - [ROS 2 Dashing Diademata](https://docs.ros.org/en/dashing/index.html) on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Network setting
  - Make sure both the device and the host are connected to the wired network with the following setting, since they are statically configured to the board (if you want to change them, please edit both `app.cpp` and `include/rtps/config.h`).
    - IP address: 192.168.11.x
      - .2 will be assigned to the board
    - Netmask: 255.255.255.0
    - Gateway: 192.168.11.1
  - The firewall on the host (Ubuntu) needs to be disabled for ROS 2 (DDS) communication (e.g. `$ sudo ufw disable`)
  - If the host is connected to the Internet other than wired network (e.g., Wi-Fi), communication with mros2 may not work properly. In that case, please turn off them.

## Getting Started

1. Prepare these items below.
- Host PC having an Ethernet port whose network is set to the above and a docker environment.
- Mbed board having an Ethernet port (listed above).
2. Build Mbed executable binary using Mbed CLI2.
```
git clone https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-mbed
cd mros2-mbed
#(Please replace the [TARGET] with the ones as below.)
# +-------------------+----------------+
# | Your target board | [TARGET]       |
# +-------------------+----------------+
# | NUCLEO-F429ZI     | NUCLEO_F429ZI  |
# | NUCLEO-F767ZI     | NUCLEO_F767ZI  |
# | Arch Max v1.1     | ARCH_MAX       |
# | NUCLEO-H743ZI2    | NUCLEO_H743ZI2 |
# | F746NG-Discovery  | DISCO_F746NG   |
# | F769NI-Discovery  | DISCO_F769NI   |
# | H747I-Discovery   | DISCO_H747I    |
# | GR-MANGO          | GR_MANGO       |
# +-------------------+----------------+
./build.bash all [TARGET] echoreply_string
```
After that, you will find an executable binary is created in the path below.
```
cmake_build/[TARGET]/develop/GCC_ARM/mros2-mbed.bin
```
3. Connect the PC and Mbed Board with USB and LAN cables.
4. Open Serial Console of the Mbed board. (115200bps)
5. Copy the executable binary above to the Mbed Board.
   (you may find it in the Nautilus file manager as NODE_F429ZI, F767ZI or DAPLINK.)
```
mbed mros2 start!
[MROS2LIB] mros2_init task start
mROS 2 initialization is completed
[MROS2LIB] create_node
[MROS2LIB] start creating participant

[MROS2LIB] create_publisher complete.
[MROS2LIB] create_subscription complete. data memory address=0x2001e170[MROS2LIB] Initilizing Domain complete

ready to pub/sub message
```
6. On the PC console, type the command below.
```
docker run --rm -it --net=host ros:foxy /bin/bash \
  -c "source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash &&
  cd &&
  git clone https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-host-examples &&
  cd mros2-host-examples &&
  colcon build --packages-select mros2_echoback_string &&
  source install/setup.bash &&
  (ros2 run mros2_echoback_string sub_node &) &&
  echo 'wait for sub_node connection' &&
  sleep 10 &&
  ros2 run mros2_echoback_string pub_node"
```
Then, we can confirm the communication between the PC and Mbed board via ROS2.

## Examples

This repository contains some example applications in [workspace/](workspace/) to communicate with ROS 2 nodes on the host.
Please also check [mROS-base/mros2-host-examples](https://github.com/mROS-base/mros2-host-examples) repository for more detail about the host examples.

You can switch the example by specifying the third argument of `build.bash`.
Of course you can also create a new program file and specify it as your own application.

### echoreply_string (default)

- Description:
  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board subscribes `string` (`std_msgs::msg::String`) message from `/to_stm` topic.
  - And then publishes this `string` message as it is to `/to_linux` as the reply.
- Host operation:
  - `$ ros2 launch mros2_echoback_string pubsub.launch.py`
  - or, at two terminals:
    - `$ ros2 run mros2_echoback_string pub_node`
    - `$ ros2 run mros2_echoback_string sub_node`

### pub_float32

- Description:
  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board publishes `float32` (`std_msgs::msg::Float32`) message to `/to_linux` topic.
    - Note that this application just print whether the value of message is less than 0.0, between 0.0 and 1.0, or greater than 1.0.
    - If you want to print float value in serial console, you need to add `"target.printf_lib": "std"` into mbed_app.json (see [detail](https://forums.mbed.com/t/float-printf-doesnt-work-in-desktop-version/9164)). Note that linking std lib will increase the size of Flash memory.
- Host operation:
  - `$ ros2 launch mros2_sub_float32 sub.launch.py`
  - or, `$ ros2 run mros2_sub_float32 sub_node`

### sub_uint16

- Description:
  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board subscribes `uint16` (`std_msgs::msg::UInt16`) message from `/to_stm` topic.
- Host operation:
  - `$ ros2 launch mros2_pub_uint16 pub.launch.py`
  - or, `$ ros2 run mros2_pub_uint16 pub_node`

### pub_twist

- Description:
  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board publishes `Twist` (`geometry_msgs::msg::Twist`) message to `cmd_vel` topic.
  - This application requires to generated header files for `Twist` and `Vector3`. See detail in [<repo_root>/README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes](../README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes).
- Host operation:
  - `$ ros2 launch mros2_sub_twist sub.launch.py`
  - or, `$ ros2 run mros2_sub_twist sub_node`

### sub_pose

- Description:
  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board subscibes `Pose` (`geometry_msgs::msg::Pose`) message to `cmd_vel` topic.
  - This application requires to generated header files for `Pose`, `Point` and `Quartenion`. See detail in [<repo_root>/README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes](../README.md#generating-header-files-for-custom-msgtypes).
- Host operation:
  - `$ ros2 launch mros2_pub_pose pub.launch.py`
  - or, `$ ros2 run mros2_pub_pose pub_node`

### mturtle_teleop

- Description:
  - This is a sample application along with [turtlesim](https://github.com/mROS-base/ros_tutorials/tree/mros2/foxy-devel/turtlesim) (mros2 version).
  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board publishes `Twist` (`geometry_msgs::msg::Twist`) message to `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic, according to the input from keyboard via serial console.
- Please see [mturtle_teleop/README.md](workspace/mturtle_teleop/README.md) for more detail including host operation.

### mturtle_teleop_joy

- Description:
  - This is a sample application along with [turtlesim](https://github.com/mROS-base/ros_tutorials/tree/mros2/foxy-devel/turtlesim) (mros2 version).
  - The mROS 2 node on the embedded board publishes `Twist` (`geometry_msgs::msg::Twist`) message to `/turtle1/cmd_vel` topic, according to the input from Joystick module.
- Please see [mturtle_teleop_joy/README.md](workspace/mturtle_teleop_joy/README.md) for more detail including host operation.

## Files for the application

On this platform, the mros2 application consists of the following files:

- app.cpp: 
  - main source of the application
  - note that the file name must be this in order to generate the templates of pub/sub functions in the build step.
- templates.hpp:
  - the templates of pub/sub functions
  - this file will be automatically generated/modified during the build step, so you do not have to care about this file

## Generating header files for custom MsgTypes

You can use almost any [built-in-types in ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html#field-types) on the embedded device.

In additon, you can define a customized message type (e.g., `Twist.msg`) in the same way as in ROS 2, and use its header file for your application. This section describes how to generate header files for your own MsgTypes (`geometry_msgs::msg::Twist` as an example).

### Prepare .msg files

`.msg` files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message (see [About ROS 2 interface](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-ROS-Interfaces.html)). In mros2, they are used to generate header files for messages in embedded applications.

Prepare `Twist.msg` file and make sure it is in `workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/`.

```
$ cat workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.msg
geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3 linear
geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3 angular
```

In this example, `Twist` has a nested structure with `Vector3` as a child element. So you also need to prepare its file.

```
$ cat workspace/custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg/Vector3.msg
float64 x
float64 y
float64 z
```

### Generate header files

To generate header files for `Twist` and `Vector3`, run the following command in `workspace/`.

```
$ cd workspace
$ python ../mros2/mros2_header_generator/header_generator.py geometry_msgs/msg/Twist.msg
```

Make sure header files for custom MsgType are generated in `custom_msgs/`

```
$ ls -R custom_msgs/
custom_msgs/:
geometry_msgs

custom_msgs/geometry_msgs:
msg

custom_msgs/geometry_msgs/msg:
twist.hpp  vector3.hpp  Twist.msg  Vector3.msg
```

You can now use them in your applicaton like this.

```
#include "mros2.hpp"
#include "geometry_msgs/msg/vector3.hpp"
#include "geometry_msgs/msg/twist.hpp"

int main(int argc, char * argv[])
{
<snip.>
  pub = node.create_publisher<geometry_msgs::msg::Twist>("cmd_vel", 10);
<snip.>
```

## Tips 1: Configure the network

`include/rtps/config.h` is the configuration file for embeddedRTPS.
We may be able to realize the RTPS communication to the appropriate configuration by editting this file.
Currently, we are unable to reconnect to the device from the host multiple times.

And also, you can configure for lwIP (UDP/IP) by `mbed_app.json`. 
Currently, we are unable to communicate large size of messages probably due to these configurations. 

We should seek the appropreate configurations or how to fit them to the demand of applications.
Please let us know about them if you have any opinions or awesome knowledges! 

## Tips 2: Getting started in 5 minutes with the online compiler

We also provide an online development environment for mros2-mbed. 
By using the following Codes on Keil Studio Cloud (a.k.a Mbed Online Complier), you can try out the power of mros2 just in 5 minutes (we wish :D
